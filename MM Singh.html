                <strong class="bold_text">Manmohan Singh</strong> is an <i>Indian Politician</i>, <i>Economist</i> and <i>Statesman</i> who has been the <b>13th</b> Prime Minister of India from <i>2004</i> to <i>2014</i>. He is also the <i>third longest</i> serving Prime minister. A member of the Indian National Congress, he was the <i>first Sikh Prime Minister</i> of India. He was also the Prime minister to be re-elected after completing a full tenure since <i>J.L Nehru</i>.
            <br><br>
                Manmohan was born in <i>Gah</i>, <b>West Punjab</b> (today in Pakistan), his family migrated to India during its partition in 1947. After obtaining his <i>doctorate in Economics</i> from <b>Oxford</b>, Singh worked for the <b>United Nations</b> during <i>9666-1969</i>. He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when <b><i>Lalit Narayan Mishra</i></b> hired him as an advisor in the <i>Ministry of Commerce & Industry</i>. During the <i>1970s</i> and <i>1980s</i>, Singh held several key posts in the Government of India, such as <i>Chief Economic Advisor</i>, <i>Governor of the Reserve Bank of India</i> and <i>Head of the Planning Commission</i>.
            <br>
                In 1991, as India faced a severe <b>Economic Crisis</b>, the newly elected PM, <i>Narasimha Rao</i>, surprisingly inducted the <i>apolitical Singh</i> into his cabinet as <b><i>Finance minister</i></b>. Over the next few years, despite strong opposition, he carried out several structural reforms that <i>Liberalised India's Economy</i>. Although these measures proved successful in averting the crisis, and enhanced his reputation globally as a leading <i>Reform-minded Economist</i>.
            <br>
                His first ministry executed several key legislations and projects, including the <i>National Rural Health Mission</i>, <i>Unique Identification Authority</i>, <i>Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme</i> and <i>Right to Information Act</i>.
            <br>
                But his second ministry government faced a <i>number of corruption charges</i> over the organisation of the <i>2010 Commonwealth Games</i>, the <i>2G Spectrum Allocation Case</i> and the <i>Allocation of Coal Blocks</i>.
            <br>
                Chided for his low-profile demeanour as Prime minister, his popularity has improved since he left office
