                <strong class="bold_text">Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi Nehru</strong> was an <i>Indian Politician</i> and a central figure of the <i>Indian National Congress</i>. She was elected as <b>third Prime Minister</b> of India in <i>1966</i> and was also the <i>First and only female Prime Minister</i> of India till <i>2022</i>. Indira was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India. She served as Prime minister from <i>January</i> <b>1996</b> to <i>March</i> <b>1977</b>.
            <br> 
                During Nehru's premiership from <i>1947</i> to <i>1964</i>, Indira was considered a key assistant and accompanied him on his numerous foreign trips. She was elected President of the <b>Indian National Congress</b> in <i>1959</i>.
            <br>
                Upon her father's death in 1964, she was appointed as a member of the <b>Rajya Sabha</b> (<i>Upper house</i>) and became a member of <i>Lal Bahadur Shastri's</i> cabinet as <b>Minister of Information and Broadcasting</b>.
            <br>
                In the <i>Congress Party's Parliamentary</i> leadership election held in early 1966 (upon the death of Shastri), she defeated her rival <b>Morarji Desai</b> to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri, after his death, as Prime Minister of India.
            <br>
                As Prime Minister, Indira was known for her <b><i>Political Intransigency</i></b> and <b><i>Unprecedented Centralisation of Power</i></b>. She went to war with Pakistan in support of <i>Independence in East Pakistan</i>, which resulted in an <i>Indian Victory</i> and the creation of <b>Bangladesh</b>.<br>
                Citing separatist tendencies, and in response to a call for revolution, Indira instituted a <b><i>State of Emergency</i></b> from <i>1975</i> to <i>1977</i>. In 1999, Indira Gandhi was named <i>"Woman of the Millennium"</i> in an Online Poll organised by the BBC.
            <br>
                After Indira's ordered military action in the <i>Golden Temple</i> in <b>Operation Blue Star</b>, her own bodyguards and <b>Sikh nationalists</b> <i>assassinated</i> her on <b><i>31 October 1984</i></b>
