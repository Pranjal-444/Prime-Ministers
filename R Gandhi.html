            <strong class="bold_text">Rajeev Gandhi</strong> was an <i>Indian Politician</i> who served as the <b>Sixth</b> Prime Minister of India from <i>1984</i> to <i>1989</i>. He took office after the 1984 assassination of his mother, then Prime Minister <b>Rajeev Gandhi</b>, to become the     <i>youngest</i> Indian Prime minister at the age of <b>40</b>.
        <br>
            Rajeev was from the <b>Politically powerful</b> <i>Gandhiâ€“Nehru</i> family, which had been associated with the <b>Indian National Congress Party</b>.
        <br>
            Gandhi attended college in the <b>United Kingdom</b>. He returned to India in <i>1996</i> and became a <i>professional Pilot</i> for the state-owned <i>Indian Airlines</i>.
            His mother Indira Gandhi was prime minister and his brother Sanjay Gandhi was a Member of Parliament; despite this, Rajeev remained apolitical. After Sanjay's death in a plane crash in <i>1980</i>, Rajeev reluctantly entered politics at the behest of Indira.
        <br>
            The following year he won his brother's Parliamentary seat of <b>Amethi</b> and became a member of the <b>Lok Sabha</b> (<i>Lower House</i>). As part of his political grooming, Rajeev was made <i>General Secretary</i> of the Congress party and given significant responsibility in organising the <i>1982</i> <b>Asain Games</b>.
        <br>
            Rajeev Gandhi's period in office was mired in controversies; perhaps the greatest crises were the <i>Bhopal disaster</i>, <i>Bofors Scandal</i> and <i>Mohd.Ahmed Khan</i> Vs <i>Shah Bano Begum</i>. Soon after installing <b>Gul Shah</b> as <i>Chief Minister</i> in <i>Jammu & Kashmir</i>, the <i>1986</i> <b>Kashmir Riots</b> erupted.
            In mid-1987, the <i>Bofors Scandal</i> damaged his <del>Corruption free</del> image and resulted in a major defeat in the <i>1989</i> election.
        <br>
            Rajeev remained Congress President until the elections in <i>1991</i>. While campaigning for the elections, he was <b>assassinated</b> by a <i>suicide bomber</i> from the (<i>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</i>) <b>LTTE</b>
