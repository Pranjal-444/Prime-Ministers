Nehru promoted <i>"Parliamentary Democracy"</i>, <i>"Secularism"</i>, and <i>"Science and Technology"</i> during the <i>1950s</i>, powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation in International affairs by building premiere institutions such as IITs & AIIMS in the field of Science & Thechnology.
